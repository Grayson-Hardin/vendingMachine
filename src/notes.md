## Future Changes

1. Refactor App.js
1. Update the vending machine items so there's variety
1. NOTE: A1 is actually "B10" on the backend...will need to change tests and all references of B10 to A1 (same for C3, etc)
1. ISSUE: If user provides insufficent funds and tries to purchase, money is lost.
